This function takes the number (22) as a parameter and supposed to return the double of this number (44). 

This function takes the number (7) and it supposed to return the square of that number. which is (49).

I predict that if sucessfull this function will output only the even numbers from the list, which are 26, 0, 28, and 4.

This function takes a list of numbers and is supposed to output just the odd numbers, which are 77, 99, 3433, 55, and 9.

I predict the the function will multiply the 3 numbers and the result should be 42.
