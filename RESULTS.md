The result of the double function is: "The double of 22 is 44"

I correctly predicted that the result of the square function is: "The square of 7 is 49"

My prediction was correct and the isEven function selected only the even numbers from the list. 

The prediction was correct, the function output consists of just odd numbers. 

The last function correctly predicted the expected result of 42.
