1. What patterns or surprises did you notice?

The pattern of "add, commit, and push" felt repetitive at first, but it helped me stay organized and helped me not to forget to document findings as I progressed. 


2. What logic challenged your thinking?

I got stuck on the for loop logic. Coming from Python, I am used to the "for num in nums" pattern. So I had to remind myself that using "in" actually outputs just the indexes of the numbers. I now know that the proper way to iterate over values in a list is by using "let for num of nums".

Regarding Git, I ran into a challenge because I forgot to save the file before trying to commit it. 

3. While working solo, like myself, makes it harder to see the benefits of version control, I realized that in a real job you always collaborate with people. Using Git to document every step of the process ensures that everyone on a team is on the same page, which is very beneficial.
